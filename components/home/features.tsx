          The Story Behind Face Me
        </h2>
        <div className="mt-6 max-w-4xl mx-auto space-y-4 text-lg text-muted-foreground">
          <p>
            The inspiration for <strong className="text-foreground">Face Me</strong> came from a simple but common problem:
          </p>
          <p>
            When shopping online, especially for fashion and beauty items, there's no easy way to 
            <em className="text-foreground"> see how you'd actually look</em> wearing them before you buy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether it's <strong className="text-primary">eyeglasses</strong>, <strong className="text-primary">lipstick</strong>, 
            <strong className="text-primary"> hats</strong>, or <strong className="text-primary">earrings</strong>, it felt like a guessing game. 
            So I thought — <em className="text-foreground">what if an app could let you try them on virtually using your real face, 
            and even let others enjoy and engage with your styled looks?</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            That's how the idea of <strong className="text-primary">Face Me</strong> was born — an AI-powered face styling and monetization app.
